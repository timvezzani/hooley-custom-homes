        <h3>Building Dreams Since 2007</h3>
        <p>
          Hooley Custom Homes was founded with a simple yet powerful vision: to
          create exceptional custom homes that perfectly blend with Central
          Utah's distinctive landscape and reflect the unique personalities of
          the families who live in them.
        </p>
        <p>
          With deep roots in Sanpete County, our family has been building and
          crafting for generations. What began as a small remodeling business
          has grown into one of the region's most respected custom home building
          companies, known for uncompromising quality and personalized service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our founder's background in traditional craftsmanship, combined with
          forward-thinking building techniques, has established a company
          culture where innovation meets time-honored building practices. This
          approach has allowed us to create homes that honor Central Utah's rich
          architectural heritage while incorporating modern amenities and
          energy-efficient features.

          <h4>Building Relationships First</h4>
          <p>
            At Hooley Custom Homes, we believe that successful projects begin
            with strong relationships. Before we draw a single line or hammer a
            single nail, we invest time in getting to know you—your lifestyle,
            preferences, needs, and dreams for your home. This
            relationship-centered approach allows us to create spaces that
            reflect who you are and how you live.

            What sets Hooley Custom Homes apart from other builders in Central
            Utah?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              What distinguishes us is our deep local roots in Sanpete County
              combined with our commitment to both traditional craftsmanship and
              modern building science. We bring generations of experience
              building in Central Utah's unique climate and terrain. Our
              relationship-focused approach means we limit the number of
              projects we take on to ensure each client receives the
              personalized attention they deserve. Additionally, our transparent
              process, quality-first mindset, and dedication to integrity have
              earned us a reputation as one of the region's most trusted
              builders.

            How long does it take to build a custom home?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The timeline for building a custom home in Sanpete and surrounding
              counties typically ranges from 6-12 months, depending on the size,
              complexity, and time of year construction begins. Weather
              conditions in Central Utah can impact construction schedules,
              particularly during winter months. At Hooley Custom Homes, we
              provide a detailed construction timeline during the planning phase
              and keep you updated on progress throughout the building process.

            What is the price per square foot for a custom home?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The cost per square foot varies widely based on many factors
              including site conditions, design complexity, finishes, and
              current material costs. In Central Utah, custom homes typically
              range from $250-$450+ per square foot. Rather than quoting a
              generic price per square foot, we prefer to discuss your specific
              project requirements to provide a more accurate estimate. This
              approach ensures transparency and helps avoid unexpected costs as
              your project progresses.

            <p>
              While having an architect is beneficial, it's not always
              necessary. At Hooley Custom Homes, we offer design-build services
              where we can handle both the design and construction of your home.
              For more complex or unique designs, we can recommend qualified
              architects in the Central Utah area who understand local building
              traditions and code requirements. We're experienced in working
              with architects and can collaborate effectively throughout the
              design and construction process.

              At Hooley Custom Homes, we believe your involvement is crucial to

              communication throughout the project, with regular meetings and

              progress, review schedules, and approve selections. We encourage
              your input on all decisions while providing expert guidance to
              help you make choices that align with both your vision and budget.

              Hooley Custom Homes provides a comprehensive 1-year workmanship
              warranty that covers all aspects of construction. We also pass
              along manufacturer warranties for materials, fixtures, and
              systems, many of which extend well beyond our workmanship
              warranty. We conduct a 6-month and 11-month warranty inspection to
              address any concerns proactively. Our commitment to quality
              doesn't end at completion—we stand behind our work and respond
              promptly to any warranty needs.

              Yes, we regularly build on client-owned lots throughout Sanpete,
              Juab, and surrounding counties. We can evaluate your property to
              assess site conditions, utility access, and any special
              considerations that might impact construction. If you haven't
              purchased land yet, we can assist in evaluating potential

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Our payment schedule is structured around construction milestones.
              Typically, this includes an initial deposit followed by progress
              payments as specific phases are completed. This approach ensures
              that payments align with actual construction progress. We provide
              a detailed payment schedule before construction begins so you know
              exactly what to expect throughout the process.

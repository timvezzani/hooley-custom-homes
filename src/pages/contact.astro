              We primarily serve Sanpete County and Juab County, including
              Manti, Ephraim, Mount Pleasant, Spring City, Moroni, Fountain
              Green, Nephi, and surrounding areas. If you're outside these

            How long does a custom home build typically take?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The timeline for a custom home build varies depending on the size,
              complexity, and specific requirements of your project. Generally,
              you can expect a custom home to take anywhere from 6 to 12 months
              from design to completion. We'll provide you with a more accurate
              timeline during our initial consultation based on your specific
              project.

          <div class="faq-question">Do you provide financing options?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              While we don't provide direct financing, we work closely with
              several local lenders who specialize in construction loans and can
              recommend options based on your needs. We're happy to coordinate
              with your lender throughout the building process.

            <p>
              No, you don't need to hire an architect before contacting us. We
              offer complete design-build services and can help you from the
              initial concept through completion. We work with trusted
              architects and designers who can create custom plans based on your
              vision, or we can work with plans you already have.

            <p>
              Yes, we stand behind our work with a comprehensive warranty
              program. New custom homes come with a 1-year workmanship warranty
              and longer warranties on specific systems and components. For
              renovations and additions, we offer a 1-year warranty on all
              workmanship. We'll provide detailed warranty information as part
              of your project proposal.
